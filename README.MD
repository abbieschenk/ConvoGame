# ConvoGame
A tool for game developers to create dialogue trees in a non-complicated manor. This tool allows developers to build conversations graphically, then export them as .json files that can be used in the game engine of your choice.

This project was created for development on [Catlandia](http://catlandiagame.com/), and was used to rapidly prototype conversations for use with Unity3D. Catlandia has been released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1219700/Catlandia_Crisis_at_Fort_Pawprint/?snr=1_5_1100__1100), the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catlandia/id1498721123?ls=1), and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PolarTabby.CatlandiaPawprint&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1).

This project is heavily inspired by my work on [ScriptEase II](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~script/), a game-independent GUI script generator built as part of the BELIEVE research group at the University of Alberta.

## No Longer Maintained
This repository is **no longer maintained** as development on Catlandia has wrapped up. I'm also working on a more generic, better coded tree editor with save functionality, and that should absolutely fix the below issue. I will link to the new project here when it is live.

## Known Issues - Use At Your Own Risk
The only two known major issue are that **looped conversations break on export,** and that there is **no accessibility support**. Exporting a dialogue with parent-less nodes aside from the original root node will also not export those parent-less nodes.

The only known minor issue is that the root node can turn red as a warning that it doesn't have a parent node â€” this shouldn't affect functionality. However, there may be other issues that are not documented as this was rapidly developed while in use by game developers. Use at your own risk!
